  <p>I was born and bred in a small town in the outer skirt of Rome, Italy and the cradle of the Roman Empire, which makes a perfect balance between small town values and good exposure to the city life and culture. The concurrence of these factors has provided me the opportunity to keep in touch with the agricultural heritage of my ancestors while being exposed to the intellectual circles of my parents. For example, there were summer days in my childhood that I started helping my grandmother and her sisters attend to their gardens, and they ended up at dinner with entrepreneurs, managers, politician, academics, and intellectuals with discussions on topics ranging from theology to quantum-physics. The aforementioned exposure to a various cultural environment since childhood enabled me to acquire a comprehensive set of interest; therefore, they have provided me with the tools needed to relate with politics, academic and industrial worlds which often speak different languages. My experience on both industry and academic research provides me with the skill-set required to build bridges between these two processes.<p>

  Tatinati Sivanagaraja is a post-doctoral research fellow in Musicology and Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College
  <p>I am a Reserach Fellow at <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/">Nanyang Technological University </a>. My area of research is machine learning and in the past year I have worked on its application in education. In my master's degree I have been specializing in a diverse set of ML techniques including Deep Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models and Natural Language Processing. I have extensive experience working with human behavioural and physiological data.</p> <!-- I dream of a world where every child irrespective of their background has an unbiased opportunity to learn their field of interest. </p>-->
  
  <p>Currently, I am being advised by Prof <a href="http://centerforknowledgecommunication.com/05bpwabout.html">Beverly Woolf</a> at the <a href="http://centerforknowledgecommunication.com/index.html">Center for Knowledge Communication</a> lab. I am also a visiting researcher at the <a href="http://ict.usc.edu/">USC Institute for Creative Technologies </a> working with Dr. <a href ="https://sites.google.com/site/benjaminnye/"> Benjamin Nye</a> and Dr. <a href="http://people.ict.usc.edu/~core/"> Mark Core</a>. </p>
  
  <p>Previously, I had a corporate stint at <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/index.html"> Cisco Systems</a>, where I worked as a Software Engineer primarily solving complex problems in Service Supply Chain and also researching on applying data driven intelligence to aid decisioning. </p>
