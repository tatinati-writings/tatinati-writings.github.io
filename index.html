  <p>I am a graduate student at <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>. My area of research is machine learning and in the past year I have worked on its application in education. In my master's degree I have been specializing in a diverse set of ML techniques including Deep Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models and Natural Language Processing. I have extensive experience working with human behavioural and physiological data.</p> <!-- I dream of a world where every child irrespective of their background has an unbiased opportunity to learn their field of interest. </p>-->
  
  <p>Currently, I am being advised by Prof <a href="http://centerforknowledgecommunication.com/05bpwabout.html">Beverly Woolf</a> at the <a href="http://centerforknowledgecommunication.com/index.html">Center for Knowledge Communication</a> lab. I am also a visiting researcher at the <a href="http://ict.usc.edu/">USC Institute for Creative Technologies </a> working with Dr. <a href ="https://sites.google.com/site/benjaminnye/"> Benjamin Nye</a> and Dr. <a href="http://people.ict.usc.edu/~core/"> Mark Core</a>. </p>
  
  <p>Previously, I had a corporate stint at <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/index.html"> Cisco Systems</a>, where I worked as a Software Engineer primarily solving complex problems in Service Supply Chain and also researching on applying data driven intelligence to aid decisioning. </p>
  
  <p>You can read more about me <a href ="/about">here</a>, about my research <a href="/research">here</a> and my list of projects <a href="/projects">here</a>. Needless to say, I'm socially active and can be reached out at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShamyaKarumbaiah">FB</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shamya-karumbaiah-54901222">Linkedin</a> or with a good old <a href = "mailto:shamya16@gmail.com">mail</a>.
